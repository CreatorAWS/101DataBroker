    <p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

    <p>Revised: April 24, 2021</p>

    <p>We at {$sm.resourcename} LLC (“{$sm.resourcename}” or “we” or “us” or “our”) know that your privacy is important. This privacy policy (“Policy”) is designed to assist you in understanding how we will collect and use the information you provide when you use our publicly available website at {$sm.resourcename} and www.{$sm.resourcename} (together, the “Sites”), our sales and marketing software and service platform (our “Platform”), and other related services on which we post a direct link to this privacy policy (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

    <p>Please read this Policy to learn more about the ways in which we collect and use your information. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you in accordance with the process described in the “Revisions or Changes” section of this Policy, below. By using our Services, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Policy.

    <p>This Policy is not exclusive. In particular, if you use our Platform, the data that you and your customers submit as you use our Platform will be further governed by the applicable {$sm.resourcename} agreement and as required by law.

    <p>For the purposes of our Policy, when we refer to “you” or to a “client” we mean any past, current or prospective client or customer of {$sm.resourcename}, including any visitor to one of our Sites.

    <p>Everyday language summaries are provided for your benefit but are not legally binding.

    <p><strong>This is our Privacy Policy. It applies to our websites and our marketing platform.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What We Collect.</strong> In some situations you may provide us with your personally identifiable information, which could include your name, street address, telephone number, email address, job title, payment card number, other financial account number(s), mother’s maiden name or other family names, date and place of birth, photographic image, and any other information we collect about you that by itself is not personally identifiable information but if combined with personally identifiable information could be used to personally identify you.</p>

    <p>You may provide us with personally identifiable information when you complete a survey; make a purchase; request customer support; subscribe to certain services, email notifications and/or newsletters; register for our Platform, or register and/or set up an account/profile to access, visit and/or use certain portions of our Sites; provide comments, reviews, feedback, or testimonials about our products or Services; and any other transactions between you and us on or in relation to our Services.</p>

    <p><strong>We may use your information on an anonymous basis when aggregating data. We may transfer your information if we sell our business.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Disclosures Made by You within Interactive Areas of a Site.</strong> If you use a bulletin board, blog, comment or discussion forum or chat room (collectively, “forums”) made available on a Site or on Facebook, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages, and could be potentially searchable through search engines. We are not responsible for the potential misuse by third parties of any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these various forums.</p>

    <p><strong>Forums or similar portions of our Sites or third party sites may have different, looser rules regarding your personal information.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Other General Policies Relating to Privacy</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Disclosures by Children.</strong> We believe that protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important and for that reason we will never collect or maintain information on our Sites from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our Sites is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not design our Sites to attract children under 13 and will not collect or maintain information from them.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Third Party Sites.</strong> Our Sites may contain links to third party websites. Please note that the privacy and other policies of any such third party website may differ materially from this Policy. We strongly recommend that clients review the privacy policies of any such third party prior to submitting personally identifiable information. {$sm.resourcename} has no control over and is not responsible for the information practices of other websites, including those to which we may link and those which may link to us.</p>

    <p><strong>Third party sites are governed by their own privacy policies.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Use of Widgets.</strong> We may provide widgets on our Sites that make it possible to share information on third-party platforms. These widgets do not store your personally identifiable information. Our Sites may also include social media features, such as the Facebook® or Twitter® button and similar widgets and interactive mini-programs that run on our Sites (each, a “Feature”). To the extent we use these Features, they may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media Features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing the Feature or widget.</p>

    <p><strong>Any features, widgets or mini-programs provided by or for social media sites or other third parties may collect personal information and are subject to the privacy polies of those third parties.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Use of Cookies.</strong> When you interact with the Sites, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit our Sites, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer’s hard drive and are used to indicate whether you have visited the Sites previously. The data collected may include how you navigate around a web page and the most commonly clicked links on a specific web page. Certain technical information, such as your browser version and operating system, are also collected. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set (each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). We use cookies for a number of purposes, including to: access a client’s account information when a client logs into a Site, so that we can provide the client with customized content, keep track of preferences you specify while you are using the Services, and to estimate and report total audience size (unique users) and traffic for our Sites, and to conduct research to improve the content and services of our Sites.</p>

    <p><strong>Our Sites use cookies. Your browser probably lets you control whether it allows the use of cookies.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> We may use web beacons to access cookies and count users who visit our Sites or open our HTML-formatted email messages. Web beacons are single-pixel graphic files with a unique identifier, similar to cookies. Web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and emails and are stored on a user’s hard drive.

    <p><strong>Our Sites may use web beacons. Your browser probably lets you control web beacons.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Third-Party Cookies.</strong> We may also from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Sites to help us administer our Sites and improve their quality. Such third parties may use cookies and web beacons to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies and web beacons may track how you interact with a Site through the use of cookies and the data collected may include how you navigate around a web page and the most commonly clicked links on a specific web page. Certain technical information, such as your browser version and operating system, may also be collected. If collected, this information will be used by us to evaluate and, if necessary, modify the relevant Site to improve the functions and ultimately, make it easier for clients to use. None of your personally identifiable information, that is, your name, address, or phone number, is collected through such collections.</p>

    <p><strong>We may engage third parties to help us run our Sites. These third parties may also use cookies and web beacons.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting.</strong> We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other websites. Any such ad network partners may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Sites and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. To opt out of this type of cookies, visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
